## Flashcards

üìù `NOTE:` Paste the README templates for each subsequent lab here at the top, (i.e. lab 2, 3, 4). This will show a history of your development process including which users stories you completed and how your app looked and functioned at each step.

## Lab 2

### App Description
I continued to make my flashcards app better, adding new features on top of everything I did in the previous lab. I created a new screen where users are going to be able to create new flashcards right from the app. That way whenever users want to study something new they can just create a new flashcard and utlize the flashcard app to test themselves instantly. Users click the plus sign on the main screen to add a question and answer.

While building this you will learn how to create completely new screens, how to present them from your main screen, and how to pass data from one screen to another.

## Lab 1

### App Description
This app asks one question, and the user can click on the question label to the answer label which is of a different color for easier distinguishing. The user can also toggle the flashcard between the question side and the answer side. There is only one question at the moment, but I am working on adding more questions.
